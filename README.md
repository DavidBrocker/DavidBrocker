# 👋 Hi there, I'm Dave!

**📍 Psychologist | 🧠 Curiosity Researcher | 💻 R/Shiny Enthusiast | 🎓 Educator**

Welcome! I’m an experimental psychologist and college professor who builds tools and designs studies to explore why people do weird things—and how we can make learning about it less painful (even when it’s statistics).
